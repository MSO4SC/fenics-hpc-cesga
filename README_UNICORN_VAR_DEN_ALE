//Description of the Program:

This code solves two phase flow with ALE when an solid body is immersed with an initial velocity.

1) The solid body moves accordingly with Newton's Second law only in the Y-Direction. 
So it suffices to compute the lift force each time, and move the solid body accordingly.

2)  Slip Boundaries  are imposed weakly in the  ufc/NSEbase.ufl  file
    and are equal to the mesh velocity in all boundaries (interior and exterior).

3) The immersed solid is a cube centered at the origin and with ratio 0.5  (in each axis, not diagonally)

4) The whole domain is a cube  centered at the origin and with ratio 8.0  (in each axis, not diagonally)

5) **Important: the computional domain needs to be big to have zero slip conditions at the outside boundary.
If not is possible that the whole mesh moves, i.e. the LaplacianSmoother moves all  vertices, and the
fluid velocity is not zero at the outside boundary.

6) In the class InitialDensity we set how the densities are at t=0.

7) Note about meshes:
   in the directories meshes/one_phase and meshes/two_phase the same computational domain is meshed.
   However, the one in the two_phase directory has 500,000 cells, and is meshed properly for this problem.
   The meshes in meshes/one_phase are for development and quick experimentation. In both cases the gmsh
   file  (.geo) is also distributed.
